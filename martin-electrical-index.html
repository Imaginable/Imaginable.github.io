        <p>According to the FBI, a burglary occurs somewhere in the United States every 15.4 seconds. Here are six home security tips to prevent your home from being one of them.</p>
        <ul class="safety-list">
            <li>Use interior light timers to establish a pattern of occupancy when away on vacation and at home.</li>
            <li>Exterior lighting shoudl allow 100-feet of visibility for both the front and back of the property.</li>
            <li>Use good lighting along the pathway and at your door.</li>
            <li>Use light timers or photo-cells to turn on/off lights automatically set for both dusk and dawn.</li>
            <li>Use infra-red motion sensor lights on the rear of single family homes.</li>
            <li>Alarm systems need to be properly installed and maintained. Alarm systems can monitor for fire as well as burglary for the same price. All systems should have an audible horn or bell to be effective in case someone does break in. However, hese audible alarms should be programmed to reset automatically after one or two minutes.</li>
        </ul>
